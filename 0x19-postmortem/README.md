Postmortem
This postmortem is about an experience that happened to me.

Issue Summary
I developed a website for advertising within my school, students can advertise goods and services on the website, 2 weeks into it, people started complaining that they can't upload their stuff on the website again.

Timeline
February 2022

Reports on the website about it not functioning properly

February 2022

I employed someone who had more knowledge to help me fix it

Cause and Solution
The website was already gaining traffic and there was not enough space on the server

Corrective measures
I had to employ someone to fix it but i later had to take the website down cause i couldn't maintain it
